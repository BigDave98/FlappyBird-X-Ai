<h1>Flappy Bird AI<h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>This project was created with the aim of improving my programming, machine learning, and English skills. Initially, I recreated the famous game Flappy Bird using Python and the Pygame library. Later on, I developed an artificial intelligence capable of playing the game flawlessly using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
To play the game, simply run the flappy_bird.py file. You control the bird by pressing the spacebar to make it jump and avoid the pipes. The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding.

<h3>How the AI Works</h3>
The artificial intelligence was trained using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The NEAT algorithm evolves neural networks to control the bird in the game. The networks receive inputs from the game environment, such as the bird's position and the position of the pipes, and learn to make decisions to maximize their score.
